                    I was born in Queens Village, New York in the middle of an ice storm on February 9, 1994. I have one younger sibling named Josh. He'll be 21 in November; we're exactly 4 years and 9 months apart in age. He was born in New Jersey.

                    My family moved to Mooresville, NC in August of 2003 right before I started 4th grade. Since the world fortunately didn't end in 2012, I continued my studies and then graduated from UNC Charlotte in 2016 with a B.S. in Psychology.
                    Right after that, I went to CPCC for a certificate in ophthalmic medical assisting. I learned a lot about the eyes and how they're connected to wholistic health. With that knowledge, I spent the last 2 years working with a pediatric ophthalmologist.
