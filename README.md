# lbernadel.github.io

## Description
The purpose of this project was to build a basic website to showcase my work during the Triology Edu. Fullstack Web Development Coding Bootcamp. I had to implement a series of concepts that were taught during Week 1 regarding HTML+CSS: float, padding, margin, display, overflow, clear and text-align. The format & styling guidelines for the end result are in the Instructions folder of this repository. 

A secondary task was to practice using GitHub to clone repositories and push changes from my device to GitHub as to update my webpage.

## Challenges
My main challenge was the element spacing-related CSS attributes. Even after completing the project with my novice skills, I still don't quite understand half of them. Other challenges include the time it took me to complete the format and styling of each page, understanding the sources I used to supplement my new knowledge, and the struggle of ignoring my perfectionist nature. The former items I expect to change with time; the latter, will be more diffucult.
